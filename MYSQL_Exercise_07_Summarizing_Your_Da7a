SELECT d.dog_guid AS DogID, d.user_guid AS UserID, AVG(r.rating) AS AvgRating, 
       COUNT(r.rating) AS NumRatings, d.breed, d.breed_group, d.breed_type
FROM dogs d, reviews r
WHERE d.dog_guid=r.dog_guid AND d.user_guid=r.user_guid
GROUP BY d.user_guid
HAVING NumRatings >= 10
ORDER BY AvgRating DESC
LIMIT 200

SELECT之后跟着的顺序 决定了 output的数据顺序。

注意缩写行在FROM那的写法  空格+直接缩写
%%sql
SELECT c.test_name,d.user_guid AS UserID, d.dog_guid AS DogID, d.breed, d.breed_group, d.breed_type
FROM dogs d, complete_tests c
WHERE d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid
HAVING c.test_name='Yawn Warm-up';


In theory, you can join as many tables together as you want or need. 
To join multiple tables you take the same approach as we took when we were joining two tables together: 
list all the fields you want to extract in the SELECT statement, specify which table they came from in the SELECT statement, 
list all the tables from which you will need to extract the fields in the FROM statement, 
and then tell the database how to connect the tables in the WHERE statement.

FROM dogs d,site_activities s
WHERE d.dog_guid=s.dog_guid 
AND s.script_detail_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY d.breed
ORDER BY COUNT(s.script_detail_id) DESC;
