found fields in the table:
%%sql
DESCRIBE dogs;


SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT)
SELEC COUNT(*)

%%sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(test_name))
FROM exam_answers;


AVG不是AVE often typo here.
"" at end.
%%sql
SELECT test_name, AVG(rating)AS AVG_rating, MIN(rating)AS MIN_rating, MAX(rating)AS MAX_rating
FROM reviews
WHERE test_name ="memory versus Pointing";


%%sql
SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time) AS "Duration"
FROM exam_answers; 

%%sql
SELECT AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)) AS AVGDuration
FROM exam_answers
LIMIT 2000;

%%sql
SELECT AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)) AS AVGTreatDuration
FROM exam_answers
WHERE test_name='Treat Warm-Up'
LIMIT 2000;

不能用SELECT MIN AN MAX,要用逗号
%%sql
SELECT MIN(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)) AS minDuration, 
MAX(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)) AS MaxDuration

把*放首先 然后WHERE那限制，不要令命名duration在第一行
%%sql
SELECT*
FROM exam_answers
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)<0;
FROM exam_answers;


第一行重命名之后，之后的行不能用新column name代替，还是要打出全部
%%sql
SELECT COUNT (TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)) AS duration
FROM exam_answers
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)<0;

选择任一column
%%sql
SELECT*
FROM exam_answers
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)<0;
