%%sql
SELECT test_name, AVG(rating) AS AVG_Rating
FROM reviews
GROUP BY test_name;


%%sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(dog_guid)),gender,breed
FROM dogs
GROUP BY gender,breed
ORDER BY COUNT(dog_guid) DESC;


%%sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(dog_guid)),gender,breed
FROM dogs
GROUP BY 2,3
ORDER BY 1 DESC;


hour放在TIMESTAMPDIFF里不是AVE后
HAVING 不是 WHERE 这里要求条件满足同时HAVING 保持状态即可。
%%sql
SELECT AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR,start_time,end_time)),test_name
FROM exam_answers
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)<6000
GROUP BY test_name
HAVING AVG (TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time))>0
ORDER BY AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR,start_time,end_time)) DESC;

order: SELECT/FROM/WHERE/GROUP/HAVING/ORDER BY/LIMIT
Having后不能用数字
HAVING/GROUP里的选项必须也在SELECT中出现
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(dog_guid)),gender,breed,breed_group
FROM dogs
WHERE breed_group IS NOT NULL OR breed_group!="None" OR breed_group!=""
GROUP BY 2,4
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT(dog_guid))>=1000
ORDER BY 1 DESC;


%%sql
SELECT AVE(cretated_at),AVG(gender,breed,breed_group
FROM dogs
WHERE breed_group IS NOT NULL OR breed_group!="None" OR breed_group!=""
GROUP BY 2,4
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT(dog_guid))>=1000
ORDER BY 1 DESC;


breed_type在哪位置 决定output 哪一个column在第一
%%sql
SELECT AVG(total_tests_completed),breed_type, AVG(mean_iti_minutes)
FROM dogs
GROUP BY 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC;


%%sql
SELECT COUNT DISTINCT(user_guid),state,zip
FROM users
WHERE country=US
ORDER BY state ASC, COUNT DISTINCT(user_guid) DESC;

DISTINCT后不用加phrase
US是string 记得“”
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_guid),state,zip,country
FROM users
WHERE country="US"
GROUP BY state,zip
ORDER BY state ASC, COUNT(DISTINCT user_guid) DESC;
