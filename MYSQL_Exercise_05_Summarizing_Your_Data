order: SELECT/FROM/WHERE/GROUP/HAVING/ORDER BY/LIMIT
Having后不能用数字
HAVING/GROUP里的选项必须也在SELECT中出现
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(dog_guid)),gender,breed,breed_group
FROM dogs
WHERE breed_group IS NOT NULL OR breed_group!="None" OR breed_group!=""
GROUP BY 2,4
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT(dog_guid))>=1000
ORDER BY 1 DESC;


%%sql
SELECT AVE(cretated_at),AVG(gender,breed,breed_group
FROM dogs
WHERE breed_group IS NOT NULL OR breed_group!="None" OR breed_group!=""
GROUP BY 2,4
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT(dog_guid))>=1000
ORDER BY 1 DESC;


breed_type在哪位置 决定output 哪一个column在第一
%%sql
SELECT AVG(total_tests_completed),breed_type, AVG(mean_iti_minutes)
FROM dogs
GROUP BY 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC;


%%sql
SELECT AVG(HOUR) 
FROM 
WHERE AVG() <6000 AND AVE>0;
