Q4: wrong 漏在SUBSELECT里添加GROUP BY.
%%sql
SELECT dimension,AVG(num.amount)
FROM (SELECT d.dog_guid,d.dimension,COUNT(c.created_at) AS amount
      FROM dogs d JOIN complete_tests c
      ON d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid) AS num
GROUP BY num.dimension;


Q4 CORRECT
%%sql
SELECT dimension, AVG(numtests_per_dog.numtests) AS avg_tests_completed
FROM( SELECT d.dog_guid AS dogID, d.dimension AS dimension, count(c.created_at)
AS numtests
FROM dogs d JOIN complete_tests c
ON d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid
GROUP BY dogID) AS numtests_per_dog
GROUP BY numtests_per_dog.dimension;


Q5 先读SELECT derived table里的内容。derived table必须有Allias.
%%sql
SELECT num.dimension,COUNT(DISTINCT num.dog_guid)
FROM (SELECT d.dog_guid,d.dimension
      FROM dogs d JOIN complete_tests c
      ON d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid
      WHERE d.dimension IS NULL OR d.dimension =''
      GROUP BY d.dog_guid) AS num
GROUP BY num.dimension;

Q7: 检查发现EXCLUDE=1的dimension不是0. 所以选择 exclude.NULL等于 exclude=!1
%%sql 
SELECT num.dimension,AVG(num.amount)
FROM (SELECT d.dog_guid,d.dimension,COUNT(c.created_at) AS amount
      FROM dogs d JOIN complete_tests c
      ON d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid
      WHERE (d.dimension IS NOT NULL AND d.dimension!='') AND (d.exclude IS NULL)
      GROUP BY d.dog_guid) AS num
GROUP BY num.dimension;

Q9:
%%sql
SELECT d.breed,d.weight,d.exclude,MIN(c.created_at),MAX(c.created_at),COUNT(DISTINCT c.created_at)
FROM dogs d JOIN complete_tests c
 ON d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid
WHERE breed_group IS NULL
GROUP BY d.dog_guid;


Q10 题目要求的是检查有多少dog_guid 所以要夹在SELECT后。
%%sql
SELECT num.breed_group,AVG(num.amount),COUNT(DISTINCT num.dog_guid)
FROM (SELECT d.dog_guid,d.exclude,d.breed_group,COUNT(c.created_at) AS amount
      FROM dogs d JOIN complete_tests c
      ON d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid
      WHERE d.exclude IS NULL
      GROUP BY d.dog_guid) AS num
GROUP BY num.breed_group;


Q11
%%sql 1.IN后面用（），2. HAVING和WHERE输出结果 COUNT DISTINCT dog_guid slight diff.
SELECT num.breed_group,AVG(num.amount),COUNT(DISTINCT num.dog_guid)
FROM (SELECT d.dog_guid,d.exclude,d.breed_group,COUNT(c.created_at) AS amount
      FROM dogs d JOIN complete_tests c
      ON d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid
      WHERE d.exclude IS NULL
      GROUP BY d.dog_guid) AS num
WHERE num.breed_group IN ('Sporting','Hound','Herding','Working')
GROUP BY num.breed_group;
breed_group	AVG(num.amount)	COUNT(DISTINCT num.dog_guid)
Herding	11.0560	1749
Hound	9.8492	557
Sporting	10.8710	2449
Working	10.0199	855

Q11 CORRECT 用HAVING
%%sql
SELECT breed_group, AVG(numtests_per_dog.numtests) AS avg_tests_completed,
COUNT(DISTINCT dogID)
FROM( SELECT d.dog_guid AS dogID, d.breed_group AS breed_group,
count(c.created_at) AS numtests
FROM dogs d JOIN complete_tests c
ON d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid
WHERE d.exclude IS NULL OR d.exclude=0
GROUP BY dogID) AS numtests_per_dog
GROUP BY breed_group
HAVING breed_group IN ('Sporting','Hound','Herding','Working');
breed_group	avg_tests_completed	COUNT(DISTINCT dogID)
Herding	11.2469	1774
Hound	10.0603	564
Sporting	10.9915	2470
Working	10.2358	865


Q13 mine
%%sql
SELECT num.breed_type,COUNT(DISTINCT num.dog_guid),AVG(num.amount)
FROM (SELECT d.breed_type,d.dog_guid,COUNT(c.created_at) AS amount
      FROM dogs d JOIN complete_tests c
      ON d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid
      WHERE d.exclude IS NULL
      GROUP BY d.dog_guid) AS num
GROUP BY num.breed_type;


%%sql CORRECT
SELECT breed_type, AVG(numtests_per_dog.numtests) AS avg_tests_completed,
COUNT(DISTINCT dogID)
FROM( SELECT d.dog_guid AS dogID, d.breed_type AS breed_type,
count(c.created_at) AS numtests
FROM dogs d JOIN complete_tests c
ON d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid
WHERE d.exclude IS NULL OR d.exclude=0
GROUP BY dogID) AS numtests_per_dog
GROUP BY breed_type;



Q14:
%%sql
SELECT d.dog_guid,d.breed_type,
CASE WHEN d.breed_type='PureBreed' THEN 'Pure_Breed'
    ELSE 'Not_Pure_Breed' 
    END,COUNT(c.created_at)
FROM dogs d,complete_tests c
WHERE d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid
GROUP BY d.dog_guid
LIMIT 50;
